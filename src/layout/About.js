					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<p>
						I am a Full-Stack Developer with around ten years of experience. I have an eye for design but
						also understand, can implement, and explain the technical side of Website Development. Some
						might consider me as a Designer that can Code.
					</p>
					<p>
						Ever since my start in web development I have strived to be on the cutting edge of new web
						technologies that could help my clients. I am always trying to increase the quality of work I
						can provide my clients, and ensure I am using the most appropriate technology for their project.
